# Kats-Yarn-master

This is a puzzle platforming game that I partially developed in Unity for my UC Irvine capstone project.

My team and I originally had these source files hosted on a GitHub account managed by UC Irvine (per the submission requirements).
That respository is now privated, and I unfortunately couldn't get in contact to have it transferred to me.
So, I took a copy of it and re-uploaded the files here. The GitHub accounts of my collaborators can be found below:

* Tristan Bock: https://github.com/Kersplosion
* David Liu: https://github.com/x3Kurai
* Avi Miller: https://github.com/Boolet
* Whitney Tran: https://github.com/musikalbeat
* David Wong: https://github.com/Alexxfinal

For convenience, a playable executable of the game can be downloaded from itch.io here:
